About SED Tool :

```
     The sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no
     files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of
     commands.  The input is then written to the standard output.

     A single command may be specified as the first argument to sed.  Multiple
     commands may be specified by using the -e or -f options.  All commands
     are applied to the input in the order they are specified regardless of
     their origin.
